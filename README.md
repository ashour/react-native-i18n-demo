# React Native i18n Demo
This is a working demo app built on React Native with the Expo
toolkit.

You can see the app running on your phone by using the
[Expo Client App](https://expo.io/tools#client). Once you
have the Client, visit
[https://expo.io/@mashour/react-native-i18n-demo](https://expo.io/@mashour/react-native-i18n-demo)
and use the QR Code for Android or "Request a Link" for iOS
to get the app running in your Expo Client.

Try switching your device language between English and Arabic
to see the localization and different writing directions at
work.

## Install and Develop Locally
To install this app and play with the code locally on your
machine, just do the following:

1. Install the [Expo CLI](https://expo.io/tools#cli)
1. Clone this repo
1. From the directory where you cloned this repo, run `yarn` or
`npm install`
1. Run `exp start`

You should now be able to see the development version of the app
in your Expo Client and develop the code with live reloading.

Happy hacking :)
